### Description
In a very old game, Ragnarok Online, there was a small chance to loot a Frilldora Card. This card allowed the player to become invisible.  
This service does the same thing. But don’t take it too seriously—it's more of a joke library. It allows you to use Unicode "gray areas" to hide invisible text behind visible characters.
